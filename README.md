Project Abstract

Online Used Cars Selling Platform


AIM

The main aim of this project is to create an application that is helpful while selling and buying
used cars.

DESCRIPTION

An Online used cars selling platform project is a web based application developed for users to
post their ads for vehicle resale. This system overcomes the problem of searching for a second
hand vehicle. People usually go to garages and showrooms in search for their desired second
hand vehicle that they wish to buy that becomes tedious at a point and even consumes a lot of
time. Hence the project helps users to get their desired vehicle details online at a single place.
In the Proposed System, the application can maintain car details like manufacturer, year of
manufacturing, price and model etc. We can also view all the car details which are kept for sale
effectively and we can search for our desired car. With this Customer can get the information
quickly like car details which have been entered clearly

Modules

This application mainly consists of 5 modules: admin module, buyer module, seller module ,
adding car module, viewing all cars module.
Admin Module:
This module is purely for an administrator of the site. He can view the users
and dealers. He can approve or deny a seller's ad and if approved the ad is shown in the viewing
all car module. He also receives an overview of the site's status when he comes online.
Buyer Module: 
Buyer can view all the car ads which are uploaded by the buyers. Buyer can
book the car and contact the seller..
Seller Module: 
Seller can create their ad via the Adding car module. All notifications for the
ad’s will be visible here.
Adding car module: 
This module is only visible for the seller. The seller can create and
upload their ad from this module which will be sent for admin’s approval.
Viewing all cars module: Here in this module, buyers can view car details in order to book
the car. This information will be helpful for the customers to know about car details and contact
the seller.
